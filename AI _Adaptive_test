Designed a real-time adaptive quiz platform using Flask and external Trivia APIs, 
incorporating a feedback loop mechanism to dynamically adjust question difficulty based on 
user performance metrics, including previous round accuracy, response time, and historical 
correctness. The system utilizes scoring logic and difficulty thresholds to escalate or reduce 
complexity, ensuring a personalized learning experience. A dedicated dashboard tracks key 
metrics such as score progression, response accuracy, and completion rate, making the platform 
ideal for formative assessments or self-paced learning.
